A hypergraph dataset where a hyperedge corresponds to a set of computer science
authors. The hyperedge is labeld by the most common conference where they
published (from a pre-determined list of 10 conferences).

The file hyperedges.txt contains lists of coauthors that published together in a
conference. Each line lists authors that published together.

The file hyperedge-labels.txt lists the most common conference corresponding to
each line (set of coauthors publishing together) in the hyperedges.txt file.

The file hyperedge-label-identities.txt lists the names of the 10 conferences,
with order in the list corresponding to the number label used in the file
hyperedge-labels.txt.
